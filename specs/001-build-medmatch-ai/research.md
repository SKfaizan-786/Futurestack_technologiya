# Research Report: MedMatch AI Technical Decisions

## AI/LLM Integration Research

### Decision: Cerebras Inference API with Llama 3.2
**Rationale**: 
- 20x faster inference compared to traditional GPU deployments
- 1M daily free tokens for development and testing
- Multiple model variants (1B for speed, 3B for accuracy, 11B/90B multimodal for future)
- OpenAI-compatible API reducing integration complexity
- Proven performance for medical reasoning tasks

**Alternatives considered**:
- OpenAI GPT-4: Higher accuracy but cost prohibitive for high-volume matching
- Local deployment: Full control but infrastructure complexity and latency issues
- Google Vertex AI: Good accuracy but vendor lock-in concerns
- Azure OpenAI: Enterprise features but cost and latency considerations

### Decision: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Eligibility Analysis
**Rationale**:
- Provides explainable decision-making required by constitution
- Improves accuracy for complex medical eligibility criteria
- Enables confidence scoring based on reasoning quality
- Facilitates debugging and improvement of matching logic

**Implementation approach**:
```python
prompt_template = """
Analyze patient eligibility for clinical trial:

Patient Profile:
{patient_data}

Trial Eligibility Criteria:
{trial_criteria}

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Extract key patient characteristics
2. Match against inclusion criteria
3. Check exclusion criteria
4. Assign confidence score (0-100)
5. Provide recommendation explanation
"""
```

## Medical NLP Research

### Decision: spaCy with Custom Medical Models
**Rationale**:
- Mature medical NLP pipeline with pre-trained models
- Efficient processing for real-time requirements
- Extensible with custom entity recognition
- Strong integration with Python ML ecosystem
- Active community and commercial support

**Alternatives considered**:
- AWS Comprehend Medical: Accurate but vendor lock-in and latency
- Google Healthcare Natural Language: Good accuracy but cost concerns
- NLTK/Stanford CoreNLP: Free but requires extensive customization
- Transformers library: Flexible but higher computational overhead

### Decision: Medical Ontology Integration (ICD-10, SNOMED)
**Rationale**:
- Standardizes medical terminology across diverse data sources
- Enables semantic matching beyond exact text matching
- Required for interoperability with healthcare systems
- Improves matching accuracy through concept hierarchies

**Implementation strategy**:
- Load ontologies as lookup dictionaries for fast access
- Use hierarchical relationships for fuzzy matching
- Cache frequently accessed concepts in Redis/memory

## Database Architecture Research

### Decision: SQLite → PostgreSQL Migration Path
**Rationale**:
- SQLite for rapid development and testing with zero configuration
- PostgreSQL for production with JSON support, full-text search, and scalability
- Shared SQLAlchemy ORM ensures seamless migration
- PostgreSQL vector extensions support future embedding-based search

**Schema considerations**:
```sql
-- Core entities with performance optimizations
CREATE TABLE patients (id, medical_data JSONB, created_at, INDEX(created_at));
CREATE TABLE trials (id, criteria JSONB, embeddings VECTOR(768), INDEX(criteria));
CREATE TABLE match_results (patient_id, trial_id, confidence, reasoning TEXT);
```

## API Integration Research

### Decision: ClinicalTrials.gov API v2.0 REST Integration
**Rationale**:
- Authoritative source for US clinical trials data
- RESTful API with comprehensive filtering and search capabilities
- Rate limiting manageable (1000 requests/hour)
- Structured JSON responses suitable for automated processing

**Integration pattern**:
```python
async def fetch_trials(cancer_type: str, location: str = None) -> List[Trial]:
    """Fetch trials with retry logic and rate limiting"""
    params = {
        "query.cond": cancer_type,
        "query.locn": location,
        "format": "json",
        "countTotal": "true"
    }
    # Implement exponential backoff and caching
```

## Performance Optimization Research

### Decision: Hybrid Search Architecture
**Rationale**:
- Combines lexical search (BM25) with semantic search (embeddings)
- Lexical search for exact medical terminology matches
- Semantic search for conceptual similarity
- Fusion scoring provides balanced relevance ranking

**Implementation approach**:
1. Index trial eligibility criteria using both methods
2. Execute parallel searches for patient query
3. Combine results using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)
4. Re-rank top candidates using LLM reasoning

### Decision: Caching Strategy for Trial Data
**Rationale**:
- Clinical trials data changes infrequently (daily/weekly updates)
- Aggressive caching reduces external API calls and improves latency
- Multi-tier caching: Redis for hot data, database for comprehensive data

**Cache layers**:
- L1: In-memory cache for frequently accessed trials (LRU, 1000 entries)
- L2: Redis cache for search results (TTL 1 hour)
- L3: Database cache with daily refresh from external APIs

## Security & Compliance Research

### Decision: Zero-Trust Data Processing Architecture
**Rationale**:
- Patient data never persisted in logs or caches
- All processing uses de-identified data with secure key management
- End-to-end encryption with separate keys for different data types
- Audit trails for all data access and processing

**HIPAA compliance measures**:
- Encrypt PHI using AES-256 with rotating keys
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for all patient data interactions
- Data retention policies with automatic purging
- Business Associate Agreements (BAA) with third-party services

## Deployment & Infrastructure Research

### Decision: Kubernetes-Native Architecture
**Rationale**:
- Native support for auto-scaling based on request volume
- Service mesh capabilities for secure inter-service communication
- ConfigMaps and Secrets for secure configuration management
- Rolling deployments with zero downtime
- Built-in monitoring and observability

**Container strategy**:
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for security and size optimization
FROM python:3.11-slim as base
# Install only production dependencies
FROM base as production
# Copy application code
# Use non-root user for security
```

## Research Validation

All technical decisions align with constitutional requirements:
- ✅ HIPAA compliance through zero-trust architecture
- ✅ Open-source technology stack (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, spaCy)
- ✅ Real-time performance through optimized caching and hybrid search
- ✅ Modular architecture with clear service boundaries
- ✅ Transparent AI decisions through chain-of-thought reasoning
- ✅ Scalable deployment through Kubernetes orchestration

**Next Phase**: Design data models and API contracts based on research findings
