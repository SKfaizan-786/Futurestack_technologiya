## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Parsed: AI-powered clinical trial matching platform for cancer patients
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: cancer patients, clinical research coordinators, healthcare providers
   ‚Üí Actions: trial matching, eligibility analysis, patient-trial connection
   ‚Üí Data: patient medical data, trial eligibility criteria, trial database
   ‚Üí Constraints: HIPAA compliance, real-time processing, accuracy requirements
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects sufficiently specified in detailed requirements
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: patient submits medical data ‚Üí AI matches trials ‚Üí results displayed
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí 15 testable requirements covering core functionality
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Patient, Trial, Eligibility Criteria, Match Result
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   ‚Üí Implementation details appropriately excluded
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A cancer patient with a recent diagnosis receives a summary of their medical condition and treatment history. They want to discover relevant clinical trials that they may be eligible for, understanding their chances of qualification and what each trial involves, so they can make informed decisions about their treatment options alongside their healthcare team.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a patient has structured medical data (diagnosis, stage, biomarkers, treatment history), **When** they submit their information to the platform, **Then** they receive a ranked list of the top 3 most relevant clinical trials with eligibility explanations within 100 milliseconds
2. **Given** a patient enters unstructured medical information in natural language, **When** the system processes their submission, **Then** the platform extracts relevant medical concepts and returns appropriate trial matches with confidence scores
3. **Given** a clinical research coordinator wants to identify potential candidates, **When** they input patient criteria, **Then** they receive trial recommendations with detailed reasoning chains for eligibility decisions
4. **Given** a patient's medical profile doesn't match any current trials, **When** they submit their information, **Then** they receive notification of no current matches and are offered to be alerted when new relevant trials become available
5. **Given** a healthcare provider needs to review trial options for multiple patients, **When** they access the platform, **Then** they can efficiently process multiple patient profiles and receive summarized recommendations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when patient data is incomplete or contains conflicting information?
- How does the system handle rare cancer types with limited trial availability?
- What occurs when trials reach enrollment capacity or close during the matching process?
- How does the platform respond when external trial database is temporarily unavailable?
- What happens when a patient's condition changes significantly between assessments?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept patient medical information in both structured JSON format and unstructured natural language text
- **FR-002**: System MUST analyze patient eligibility against clinical trial criteria in real-time with average response time under 100 milliseconds
- **FR-003**: System MUST return the top 3 most relevant clinical trials ranked by eligibility match confidence
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide detailed explanations for why each trial was recommended, including specific eligibility criteria that were met
- **FR-005**: System MUST assign confidence scores (0-100%) to each trial recommendation based on eligibility matching accuracy
- **FR-006**: System MUST support eligibility analysis for 20 or more distinct cancer types with their specific criteria
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain 90% or higher accuracy in eligibility classification based on established medical benchmarks
- **FR-008**: System MUST process unstructured eligibility criteria from trial descriptions using natural language processing
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide real-time notifications when new relevant trials become available for registered patients
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain comprehensive audit trails of all patient data interactions for compliance purposes
- **FR-011**: System MUST encrypt all patient data both at rest and during transmission
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement data minimization principles, processing only necessary medical information
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide role-based access for different user types (patients, coordinators, providers)
- **FR-014**: System MUST integrate with external clinical trial databases to maintain current trial information
- **FR-015**: System MUST generate explainable AI outputs showing the reasoning chain for each recommendation

### Key Entities
- **Patient**: Represents an individual seeking clinical trial opportunities, containing medical history, current diagnosis, treatment status, demographic information, and contact preferences for notifications
- **Clinical Trial**: Represents an active research study, containing eligibility criteria, study objectives, location information, enrollment status, sponsor details, and trial phase information
- **Eligibility Criteria**: Represents the specific medical and demographic requirements for trial participation, including inclusion criteria (required conditions), exclusion criteria (disqualifying factors), and biomarker requirements
- **Match Result**: Represents the outcome of eligibility analysis, containing confidence score, reasoning explanation, trial ranking, and specific criteria that were evaluated for the patient-trial pairing
